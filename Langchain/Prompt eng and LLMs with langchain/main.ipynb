Income tax is a tax that is levied on the income you earn from various sources such as your job, investments, and business profits.\\n\\nThe amount of income tax you pay is determined by your tax bracket, which is based on your taxable income (income after deductions and exemptions). The higher your income, the higher your tax bracket and the more taxes you will owe.\\n\\nThere are different types of income tax, including federal income tax, state income tax (depending on where you live), and sometimes local income tax. These taxes are used to fund government programs and services such as education, infrastructure, and healthcare.\\n\\nTo determine your taxable income, you will need to report all your sources of income on your tax return, which is usually due by April 15th each year. This can include your salary, wages, tips, interest earned from savings accounts or investments, and any other sources of income.\\n\\nHowever, not all of your income is subject to income tax. There are certain deductions and exemptions that can reduce your taxable income and ultimately lower your tax bill.
